findDO

Usage: findDo.exe [search string] [file or shell script to execute]

Example: findDo *.txt hw.bat


I needed a command line program that recursively searches the current directory if
found runs a shell script. Needed this as part of a build tool I was working on.

(this project also allows me to learn GIT w/o messing up current projects.)

Technical Note:

This was written in Microsoft Visual C# 2010 Express. Current settings target
the .NET Framework 4 Client Profile. It might change pending further testing.
If anything it'll go down to run on older WinXP machines.
